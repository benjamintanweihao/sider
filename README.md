# :metal: Sider â€“ A Redis client in Elixir :metal:

## NOTHING TO SEE HERE YET!

```elixir
iex> "redis" |> String.reverse
sider
```

Me learning how to write a Redis client library for great justice.

While this is a mostly educational endeavour, I hope to have a complete implementation with support for all the major features of Redis.
